Sensor Network Monitor
======================

Sensor Network Monitor (netmonitor) is a C++ program that is
designed to work with the [Smallholder Sensor Network](https://github.com/ajdonnison/smallholder-sensor-framework) to monitor
via an nRFL2401+ radio, connected to a Raspberry Pi Model B+.

This is currently just a stub, as the code develops the structure is likely to change.
