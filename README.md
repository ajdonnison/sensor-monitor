Sensor Network Monitor
======================

Sensor Network Monitor (netmonitor) is a C++ program that is
designed to work with the [Smallholder Sensor Network](https://github.com/ajdonnison/smallholder-sensor-framework) to monitor
via an nRFL2401+ radio, connected to a Raspberry Pi Model B+.

While still not great, this is a working monitor/control process.
It allows setting of configuration over the air of sensors and monitoring of the sensor status.
Currently the configuration and status management is via fixed files, one per sensor.  This has
been used to create a web interface, however it should be updated to mediate the data by a
database rather than flat files, as well as a socket interface for control.

Now searches for any status files generated by connected radios and uses that as a start-up to request configuration details.
